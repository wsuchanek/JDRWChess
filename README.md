JDRW Chess Alexa Skill - Developed by Will Suchanek, Jot Sandhu, Ryan DeBolt, and Andrew Dawkins

JDRW Chess is an Alexa Skill being built to offer an entirely voice based chess game to play with Amazon's Echo products. The idea behind this is that you can use your own board and get the feel of playing real chess while still playing against the computer. This is also useful for someone who want's to practice their chess skills against an AI but prefers not look at screens for prolonged periods of time.
